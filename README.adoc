This is a set of features/utilities for Fulcro that are considered useful but have either not yet reached maturity
or are intended to be forked into new projects in the future.

== Can I Use Them in Production?

We are following a strict usability plan with this library: we will refrain from making breaking changes/removal to
anything within, but will instead generate new namespaces for variations. This may bloat this particular library a bit,
but will ensure you can safely use it in production environments.  Please let us know when you feel a feature
is mature, and we'll consider accelerating promoting it to the main library or to its own smaller private project.

So, if you see something in here that you want to use: please feel free to do so.  The worst thing that can happen is
it proves unpopular and you have to adopt some of it into your source base later, but that's better
than having to write it from scratch, right?

== DB Helpers

The https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-incubator/blob/develop/src/main/fulcro/incubator/db_helpers.cljc[`fulcro.incubator.db-helpers`]
has helper functions to deal with Fulcro local database map format. Those are helper functions for common operations like creating
a new entity, recursively removing data and it's references.

The documentation for the functions is in the code, give a scan there to check what's available.

NOTE: The latter half of this file has things that are migrating to pessimistic-mutations.  Use those instead.

== Pessimistic Mutations

Incubator includes an API for extended pessimistic mutations. These have features like automatic loading markers,
error state merging, and initialization help.  The functions can be found in

The https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-incubator/blob/develop/src/main/fulcro/incubator/pessimistic_mutations.cljc[`fulcro.incubator.pessimistic-mutations`].

and the workspaces have a demo (which is more revealing if you have Inspect installed in Chrome and watch the app state).

The basic idea is as follows:

. A mutation `pre-action` can do an optimistic change.
. Your mutation action runs *after* the remote.
. Errors call the `error-action` part of the mutation.

So, a sample pessimistic mutation looks like this:

```
(ns app
  (:require
    [fulcro.client.mutations :as m]
    [fulcro.incubator.pessimistic-mutations :as pm]))

(m/defmutation do-something [_]
  (action [env]
    (js/console.log "Optimistic update (if needed)"))
  (ok-action [env]
    (js/console.log "Runs only if mutation is OK"))
  (error-action [env]
    (js/console.log "Runs if mutation fails."))
  (remote [env] (pm/pessimistic-mutation env)))
```

and these beefed-up mutations can be run normally (in which case the ok/error actions are no-ops), but they are
meant to be run with:

```
(pm/ptransact! this `do-something {:params 2})
```

The status is automatically merged with the component that is transacted against (via it's ident), and progress is
merged with that component along the way so that you can write UI wrappers to handle the rendering of the different states.

The data merged into your component will be under the key `::pm/mutation-response`.

It can have the following general shapes (work-in-progress):

OK:: The key will not be there.

In progress:: your component's state will include:

```
:fulcro.incubator.pessimistic-mutations/mutation-response { :fulcro.client.impl.data-fetch/type :loading }
```

API Failure:: (The mutation on the remote returned a map containing the key ::i.pm/mutation-errors):

```
:fulcro.incubator.pessimistic-mutations/mutation-response {
  :fulcro.incubator.pessimistic-mutations/error-marker :Bummer
  :fulcro.incubator.pessimistic-mutations/mutation-errors :error-33}
```

where the error marker is a user-definable bit of data that you set up when you start the tx, and mutations-errors is
what the API call placed in the response of the mutation.

Hard Failure:: The server threw and exception or the network is down.

```
:fulcro.incubator.pessimistic-mutations/mutation-response {
  :error {:fulcro.client.primitives/error #error {:message "You screwed up!!!", :data {}}}
  :fulcro.client.primitives/error "Network error"
  :fulcro.client.primitives/ref   [:demo/id 1]
  :fulcro.incubator.pessimistic-mutations/mutation-errors :network-error}}
```

The main one to look for is the last one, which will not change.  The other keys are still under refinement, but currently
the actual network error from the server (when an `ex-info` is thrown) is in the nested `:error` map.

== UI

[`fulcro.incubator.ui.core`](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-incubator/blob/develop/src/main/fulcro/incubator/ui/core.cljs)
contains functions to help using React components with Fulcro.

=== Reakit

You can use [Reakit](https://reakit.io/) wrapped with Fulcro DOM CSS support from [`fulcro.incubator.ui.reakit`](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-incubator/blob/develop/src/main/fulcro/incubator/ui/reakit.cljs).

=== React Icons

[React icons](http://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) support is provided via [`fulcro.incubator.ui.icons.*`](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-incubator/tree/develop/src/main/fulcro/incubator/ui/icons)
namespaces, just refer to the functions there to use the icons directly.

== Shadow CLJS required

Currently this library requires usage of Shadow CLJS for compilation, this is due the
direct use of libraries from NPM that are not available in cljsjs.

== Compiling workspaces

To explore the things here, clone this project and run:

```
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch workspaces
```

Then navigate to

```
http://localhost:3689/
```

You can view a precompiled version of the workspaces on [github.io](https://fulcrologic.github.io/fulcro-incubator/)
